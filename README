This project is trying to make finance api which can answer questions like:

b) Divide PE ratio of ABC company by XYZ company
c) Which stock is better on PE ratio today

We will follow a iterative apprach towards questions. First we will try to answer simple question and then we will be solving tough questions. This is a fun project.
